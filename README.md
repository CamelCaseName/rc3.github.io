# Remote Chaos Experience - rC3
This domain is intended as subdomain provider for community projects during the rC3 2020 - the replacement event for the Chaos Communication Congress of 2020. The rC3 event will be heavily based on an online 2D [workadventure](https://workadventu.re/) game with video conferencing and heavily customizable pixelart maps (see HowTo).

See [rc3.world](https://rc3.world) for the official event website from the 
CCCV Chaos Computer Club Veranstaltungsgesellschaft mbH. Any projects hosted under `*.rc3.io` are community-operated projects which are not affiliated with the CCCV mbH or the CCC e.V.
